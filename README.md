# CLSDG
 Our novel node embedding model, ***CLSDG***, will consider the cluster structure of the network in the representation space of the nodes, i.e., assuming that the potential representation of the nodes and cluster centroids in the network are already known, ***CLSDG*** is based on the following two assumptions: 1) The more similar the representation vectors of the two nodes, the greater the probability of forming an edge between them; 2) The more similar the tendency of two nodes to various clusters, the more likely the probability of forming an edge between them.
